## The Concept

Industrial aluminum profiles (2020/3030/4040 extrusion) are the LEGOs of the hardware world. But they look like... factory equipment. 
My goal was to create a set of connectors and panels that turn raw industrial profiles into **warm, high-end furniture** suitable for home use.

## The System

> "A system is defined by its constraints."

I limited the system to:
1. **2020 v-slot profiles** (Black anodized)
2. **3D printed joints** (PETG-CF for texture)
3. **Wood veneer panels** (Walnut)

## Structure

The core challenge is the connection logic. Blind joints are cleaner but harder to assemble.
I designed a custom "Cube Node" that allows 3-way connections without visible screws.

### Bill of Materials

- 2020 Profiles (Cut to size)
- M5 Button Head Screws
- Custom PLA/PETG Joints
- 5mm Plywood Panels

## Next Steps

Currently iterating on the "Water Bar" configuration—a coffee station built entirely from this system.
