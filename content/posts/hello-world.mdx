## The Problem with "Production"

Most people treat creation as a series of isolated events. You write a tweet. You code a feature. You design a UI.
But if these actions aren't connected, they don't compound.

## Building the Machine

To turn your work into an asset, you need a system (OS) that handles:
1. **Capture**: Where do ideas go?
2. **Process**: How do you refine them?
3. **Ship**: How minimal is your delivery?

### 1. Capture Everything
Don't trust your brain. Use a text file, a database, or a physical notebook. The medium matters less than the friction.

### 2. Code as Content
When you solve a bug, write it down.
```typescript
// This is an asset, not just a fix
function solveProblem() {
  return "Documented Solution";
}
```

## Conclusion

Stop working. Start building assets.
